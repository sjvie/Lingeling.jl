Julia interface for the SAT solver **Lingeling** ([Website](https://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/), [Repo](https://github.com/arminbiere/lingeling)) created by Armin Biere.

-----
As Lingeling's API is similar to that of the SAT-Solver PicoSAT, some parts of Lingeling.jl are based on the Julia bindings in [PicoSAT.jl](https://github.com/sisl/PicoSAT.jl).

<br>

## ‚ú® Features
Lingeling.jl includes some but not all functions of the Lingeling SAT-Solver:
- Constructing and destructing the solver
- Getting and setting solver options
- Adding, freezing, and melting literals
- Checking whether literals are usable/reusable
- Solving and dereferencing

The API is documented in [Lingeling.jl](https://github.com/sjvie/Lingeling.jl/blob/9f7aa366814f36fa8319c48ad1946d73a9e3545a/src/Lingeling.jl).
Some additional information may be found in the Lingeling [header file](https://github.com/arminbiere/lingeling/blob/89a167d0d2efe98d983c87b5b84175b40ea55842/lglib.h), as well as in the [PicoSAT](https://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) header file.
